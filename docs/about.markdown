This is the personal home page of Wei Liu. My name is so common among Chinese population that it is difficult to uniquely identify me, even if I tell you the following additional facts about me: I am an immigrant, software engineer, data scientist, a PhD holder, and I was once a PostDoc researcher, published 10+ papers, and granted 5+ patents.

In the grand scheme of life though, it doesn't matter if you know me or not. I'll just ask you please share the link to my GitHub if you found it resonating. Yes, I am promoting myself so I can get to do more interesing work. You can find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smartnose/).
